# ShadersTest

shaders test on web


### project version
`Unity 6000.2.3f1 LTS`

*version `2022.3.62f1 LTS` (latest 2022.3 LTS available) is way smoother!!!! ðŸ˜­&

## Shader graph testing shenanigans

### URP Lit transparent specular type
- *Specular color* slot with Scene Color node determines the "fake alpha" of result by the saturation of specular color
- on web, "fake alpha" by Scene Color + specular in *Fragment Color* slot either gives "completely opaque" or "completely transparent" result
- on web, simulating normals via *Fragment Color* manipulation dealing with opacity doesn't seem to work

- shadows cast by transparent materials doesn't seem to work on web for some reason, and perceived depth may be flattened because of that

### Other

- adding `_` parameters makes the whole shader disappear in web for some reason

- the behavior of *Smoothness* slot seems to be inverted between simulating normals in the *Fragment Color* vs. using the actual *Normal* slot
